      <ul>
        <li>He loves going on long walks and smelling everything</li>
        <li>He likes to chase after animals, leaves, and people</li>

        <li>He takes naps often and is sleeping probably 75% of the day</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

  <!-- Various miscellaneous info about buddy -->
    <section>
      <h2>Abilities, Accomplishments, and Admiration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>His small 15 pound body used to be able to jump 5 feet in the air but now that he is increasing in age, its probably only about 2 feet</li>
        <li>He barks and growls at the TV whenever there is an animal (he actually knows the meow mix jingle by heart, so he doesn't even have to look at the TV to know there's a cat when he hears it)</li>
        <li>Whenever I come home from work or school he greets me at the door and expects rubs and pets</li>
        <li>If you put your finger to your mouth and tell him to "Shh" he will bark at you. I have no clue why</li>
        <li>He brought an injured baby bird inside one day. He just picked it up in his mouth, walked inside, and set him on the floor. This proves that if he really were to catch up to a rabbit or squirrel, he wouldnt do anything</li>
        <li>I tell him often that he is beautiful and precious</li>
        <li>I love him and he deserves the world</li>
      </ul>
