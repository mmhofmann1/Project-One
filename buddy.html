  <h1>My Dog, Buddy</h1>
  <p>I have a twelve year old Cairn Terrier named buddy.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>He is the same breed as Toto from the Wizard of Oz</li>
  <li>He is a Good Boy</li>
  <li>He loves going on long walks and smelling everything</li>
  <li>He likes to chase after animals, leaves, and people</li>
  <li>He gets a big nice Treat when he is done with his walk</li>
  <li>He barks and growls at the TV whenever there is an animal (he actually knows the meow mix jingle by heart, so he doesn't even have to look at the TV to know there's a cat when he hears it)</li>
  <li>He takes naps often and is sleeping probably 75% of the day</li>
  <li>I tell him often that he is beautiful and precious</li>
  <li>Whenever I come home from work or school he greets me at the door and expects rubs and pets</li>
  <li>He sleeps at the foot of my bed every night, but in the morning around 6am he comes up the bed towards me to snuggle</li>
  <li>His small 15 pound body used to be able to jump 5 feet in the air but now that he is increasing in age, its probably only about 2 feet</li>
  <li>He loves to play tug of war with his toys</li>
  <li>If you put your finger to your mouth and tell him to "Shh" he will bark at you. I have no clue why</li>
  <li>I love him and he deserves the world</li>
